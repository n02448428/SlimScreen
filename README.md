# SlimScreen AI - Friendly Librarian

Welcome to **SlimScreen AI**—your pocket-sized, ever-helpful librarian who makes research a breeze. Imagine a dimly lit library where a warm, insightful librarian is always by your side, ready to explain any text you highlight, no matter where you are. With SlimScreen AI, you no longer have to copy-paste text between windows or apps. Instead, a lightweight chat overlay pops up right on your screen to give you real-time definitions, context, and even a bit of friendly banter.

## What It Does

SlimScreen AI is designed to be a minimal yet powerful assistant that helps you understand the content you’re reading—whether on a webpage, PDF, or other digital documents. Currently, the tool focuses on providing clear definitions and contextual insights based on the text you highlight. The goal is simple: to bring answers to you instantly, keeping your browsing or reading experience uninterrupted.

## Key Features

- **Instant Definitions:** Highlight any text, and our friendly librarian will explain it with a concise definition and real-world context.
- **Seamless Chat Overlay:** The chat box appears directly on your current page—no need to jump between apps.
- **One-Click Save & Copy:** Easily save your full conversation as a text file or copy it to the clipboard with just one click.
- **Privacy First:** Your data is never stored. Once you press the on/off toggle, your conversation history is cleared immediately.
- **Device Versatility:** Whether you’re on desktop, tablet, or mobile, SlimScreen AI adapts to your environment for a consistent and hassle-free experience.
