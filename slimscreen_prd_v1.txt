# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## SlimScreen AI - Friendly Librarian

### 1. Overview & Vision
SlimScreen AI is a lightweight, in-browser research assistant designed to eliminate the hassle of copy-pasting between apps. Acting like a friendly, knowledgeable librarian in a dimly lit, cozy library, it provides real-time definitions and context for any highlighted text. The initial focus is on text, with a smooth conversation flow—where users can ask follow-up questions in a concise, punctual manner. Future plans include potential enhancements such as image and video interpretation and even a YouTube-style picture-in-picture (PiP) feature.

### 2. Objectives
- **Primary Objective:**  
  Enable users to instantly understand any word, phrase, or text snippet they highlight on any webpage or document (including PDFs), without having to leave their current view.
- **Secondary Objectives:**  
  - Provide a minimal, privacy-first tool that clears user data immediately upon deactivation.
  - Offer seamless integration across devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) with device-specific interaction methods.
  - Maintain an engaging, consistent tone with a smart, friendly female librarian persona.

### 3. MVP Scope
- **Core Features:**
  - **Text Definitions & Context:**  
    The tool scans the current page, identifies highlighted text, and provides a clear, concise definition with contextual insights.
  - **Smooth Conversational Interface:**  
    A chat overlay where the user can ask follow-up questions in a fluid, natural conversation.
  - **On/Off Toggle & Data Privacy:**  
    A bookmarklet acts as the on/off switch that also clears conversation history instantly. No user data is stored.
  - **Save & Copy Functionality:**  
    One-click buttons to save the conversation as a text file or copy it to the clipboard.
- **Delivery Mechanism:**  
  - **Primary:** A bookmarklet for desktop (with a copy-to-clipboard option for mobile) that injects the overlay into any webpage.
  - **Alternate Mechanisms (Future Considerations):**  
    - A dedicated browser extension.
    - A minimal Progressive Web App (PWA) with a floating widget.
    - Native overlay features (e.g., picture-in-picture style on iOS).

### 4. User Experience & Interface
- **Desktop Experience:**
  - **Activation:**  
    Users add the bookmarklet by dragging it from the homepage. They highlight text on any page and press a keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+X) to open the chat overlay.
  - **Interaction:**  
    The overlay appears as a semi-transparent, unobtrusive floating window with a sleek, minimal design. It includes an X button at the top-right to close (and clear) the conversation, along with visible buttons for saving and copying the conversation.
- **Mobile/Tablet Experience:**
  - **Activation:**  
    Users tap a “Copy Bookmarklet” button on the homepage, then follow device-specific instructions (e.g., for iOS, add a bookmark and edit its URL; for Android, create a new bookmark and replace the URL with the provided code).
  - **Interaction:**  
    A small, round floating widget appears which users can tap to toggle the overlay. The design remains minimal and nearly invisible, inspired by Apple's semi-transparent overlays, ensuring it doesn't interfere with reading.
- **Future UI Enhancements:**  
  - A voice-interaction feature.
  - Persistent overlay via PiP mode for native apps (subject to iOS restrictions).

### 5. Technical Specifications & Stack
- **Core Technologies:**  
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.
  - JSON files for configuration and content data.
  - A Node.js library for server-side functions (if applicable) with minimal dependencies.
- **Performance & Privacy Requirements:**  
  - Fast load times and minimal footprint to support quick injections into webpages.
  - No data storage: conversations are held temporarily in the client session and cleared when toggled off.
  - Minimal use of cookies or any persistent data to ensure user privacy.
- **Potential Optimizations:**  
  - Streamlined code to reduce load times.
  - Efficient caching strategies for static assets.

### 6. Milestones & Timeline
- **MVP Development (Immediate):**
  - Finalize core functionality: text definition extraction and chat overlay interface.
  - Implement bookmarklet injection and copy-to-clipboard feature with device-specific instructions.
  - Ensure privacy features: auto-clear conversation and no data retention.
- **Beta Testing & Feedback:**  
  - Launch MVP internally/with select users (target release: tomorrow).
  - Monitor load times, server capacity, and user engagement.
- **Post-MVP Enhancements (Future):**
  - Explore image and video interpretation features.
  - Investigate alternative delivery mechanisms (e.g., browser extension, PWA, native overlay with PiP).
  - Add voice interaction capabilities.
  - Develop a robust marketing strategy and user acquisition plan.

### 7. Success Metrics
- **Performance:**  
  - Fast load times and smooth injection on any webpage.
- **User Engagement:**  
  - Number of times users activate the tool.
  - Daily active users and peak engagement metrics.
- **Traffic & Feedback:**  
  - Traffic to the homepage.
  - User feedback via social channels (e.g., engagement on X/Twitter).
- **Scalability:**  
  - Server load testing to ensure the backend can handle bursts of activity.

### 8. Risks & Mitigation Strategies
- **Awareness & Adoption:**  
  - Risk: Users might not know about or understand how to install the bookmarklet.
  - Mitigation:  
    - Clear, device-specific instructions and a “Copy Bookmarklet” button.
    - Include a brief onboarding guide on the homepage.
- **Technical Limitations on iOS:**  
  - Risk: iOS restrictions might limit persistent overlay functionality.
  - Mitigation:  
    - Focus on robust in-browser functionality for Safari.
    - Consider a native or PWA solution for future iterations.
- **User Privacy Concerns:**  
  - Risk: Users may worry about data security.
  - Mitigation:  
    - Clearly state that no data is stored and conversation history is cleared immediately.
    - Use simple, transparent privacy messaging throughout the tool.

### 9. Marketing Strategy
- **Initial Launch:**  
  - Leverage social media (especially on X/Twitter) and online communities (e.g., Reddit, Hacker News) to announce the release.
  - Offer early access invites and gather feedback from power users (researchers, book lovers, digital readers).
- **Content Marketing:**  
  - Publish blog posts and short demo videos showcasing real-world use cases.
  - Create a short narrative about the friendly librarian in a cozy, dimly lit library setting to engage potential users.
- **Partnerships & Outreach:**  
  - Reach out to digital reading platforms and academic communities for collaborations.
- **User Retention & Engagement:**  
  - Encourage user testimonials and feedback.
  - Monitor engagement metrics and iterate quickly based on user needs.

### 10. Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
- **Advanced Content Interpretation:**  
  - Extend capabilities to interpret images and videos.
- **Persistent Overlay via Native Apps:**  
  - Explore a PiP-style overlay that can persist across apps on iOS and Android.
- **Voice Interaction:**  
  - Introduce voice input/output for a hands-free research experience.
- **Alternative Delivery Mechanisms:**  
  - Develop a dedicated browser extension or PWA to complement the bookmarklet approach.
