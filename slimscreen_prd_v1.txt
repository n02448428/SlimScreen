# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## SlimScreen AI - Friendly Librarian

### 1. Overview & Vision
SlimScreen AI is a lightweight, in-browser research assistant designed to eliminate the hassle of copying and pasting text between apps. Imagine a dimly lit library where a warm, knowledgeable librarian stands ready to explain any word or phrase you highlight. The initial focus is on text—offering clear definitions and contextual insights with a smooth conversation flow. In the future, the tool could expand to interpret images and even video, and eventually explore a persistent overlay (like YouTube's PiP) for native devices.

### 2. Objectives
- **Primary Objective:**  
  Enable users to instantly understand any highlighted text on a webpage or document (including PDFs) by delivering precise definitions and context—directly on the page without disrupting their workflow.
  
- **Secondary Objectives:**  
  - Provide a smooth, conversational interface for follow-up questions.
  - Ensure the tool is minimal, lightweight, and privacy-first (clearing conversation history immediately upon deactivation).
  - Offer device-specific interaction methods to provide a seamless experience across desktop, mobile, and tablets.

### 3. MVP Scope
- **Core Features:**
  - **Text Definitions & Context:**  
    The tool scans the current page, identifies highlighted text, and provides a clear, concise definition with contextual insights.
  - **Conversational Interface:**  
    A chat overlay where the user can ask follow-up questions in a natural, research-focused conversation with a friendly, punctual librarian.
  - **On/Off Toggle & Privacy:**  
    The bookmarklet acts as an on/off button. Toggling it off clears the conversation history immediately, ensuring no data is stored.
  - **Save & Copy Functionality:**  
    One-click buttons allow users to save the full conversation as a text file or copy it to the clipboard.
  
- **Delivery Mechanism:**  
  - **Primary:** A bookmarklet that users add to their bookmarks bar (with a "Copy Bookmarklet" option for mobile) to inject the overlay on any webpage.
  - **Alternate Mechanisms (Future Considerations):**  
    - A dedicated browser extension.
    - A minimal Progressive Web App (PWA) with a floating widget.
    - Native overlays with persistent Picture-in-Picture functionality.

### 4. User Experience & Interface
- **Desktop Experience:**
  - **Activation:**  
    - Users visit the homepage and click the **"Copy Bookmarklet"** button.
    - They drag the bookmarklet to their bookmarks bar.
    - On any webpage, they highlight text and press a keyboard shortcut (e.g., **Ctrl+Shift+X**) to open the chat overlay.
  - **Interface:**  
    - The overlay appears as a sleek, semi-transparent floating window that doesn’t obstruct the content.
    - It features an X button at the top-right to close (and clear) the conversation, alongside one-click buttons for saving and copying the conversation.
  
- **Mobile/Tablet Experience:**
  - **Activation:**  
    - Users tap the **"Copy Bookmarklet"** button on the homepage to copy the bookmarklet code.
    - They follow clear, device-specific instructions (e.g., on iOS: add a bookmark in Safari and edit its URL with the code; on Android: create a new bookmark with the code as the URL).
  - **Interface:**  
    - A small, round floating widget appears, which can be tapped to toggle the overlay.
    - The design remains minimal and nearly invisible—reminiscent of Apple’s half-transparent overlays—so it feels like air: unobtrusive yet indispensable.
    - The overlay includes an input for follow-up questions, save/copy buttons, and will eventually support voice interaction.

### 5. Technical Specifications & Stack
- **Core Technologies:**  
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.
  - JSON files for configuration and content data.
  - A Node.js library for any necessary server-side functions.
- **Performance & Privacy Requirements:**  
  - Fast load times with a minimal footprint to allow quick injection into any webpage.
  - No persistent data storage; conversation history is cleared instantly when toggled off.
  - Minimal use of cookies or persistent identifiers to ensure complete privacy.

### 6. Milestones & Timeline
- **MVP Development (Immediate):**
  - Finalize core functionality: text definition extraction, chat overlay interface, and conversation flow.
  - Implement the bookmarklet injection and copy-to-clipboard feature with clear, device-specific instructions.
  - Integrate on/off toggle that clears conversation history to meet privacy requirements.
  
- **Beta Testing & Feedback:**  
  - Launch MVP internally or to select power users (target release: tomorrow).
  - Monitor performance metrics (load times, server load) and user engagement.
  
- **Post-MVP Enhancements (Future Roadmap):**
  - Add image and video interpretation capabilities.
  - Explore alternative delivery mechanisms (browser extension, PWA, native overlay with PiP).
  - Introduce voice interaction features.
  - Develop and execute a comprehensive marketing strategy for broader user adoption.

### 7. Success Metrics
- **Performance:**  
  - Quick load times and smooth injection across all supported devices.
- **User Engagement:**  
  - Frequency of activation, daily active users, and overall usage patterns.
- **Traffic & Feedback:**  
  - Website traffic, user engagement on social channels, and qualitative feedback.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Ability to handle peak loads and server responsiveness during high-traffic periods.

### 8. Risks & Mitigation Strategies
- **Awareness & Adoption:**  
  - **Risk:** Users may struggle to add the bookmarklet or not understand its benefits.
  - **Mitigation:** Provide clear, device-specific instructions and a "Copy Bookmarklet" button; include a simple onboarding guide.
- **iOS Limitations:**  
  - **Risk:** iOS restrictions might limit persistent overlay functionality across apps.
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on robust in-browser functionality; consider alternative delivery mechanisms for persistent overlays in future updates.
- **Privacy Concerns:**  
  - **Risk:** Users may worry about data tracking.
  - **Mitigation:** Clearly communicate that no user data is stored and conversation history is auto-cleared; use transparent privacy messaging.

### 9. Marketing Strategy
- **Initial Launch:**  
  - Leverage social media platforms (e.g., X/Twitter) and online communities (e.g., Reddit, Hacker News) to announce the release.
  - Offer early access invites and engage with power users (researchers, book lovers, digital readers).
- **Content Marketing:**  
  - Create blog posts and demo videos that showcase real-world use cases.
  - Use the narrative of the friendly librarian in a cozy, dimly lit library to engage potential users.
- **Partnerships & Outreach:**  
  - Explore collaborations with digital reading platforms and academic communities.
- **User Retention & Engagement:**  
  - Encourage user testimonials, reviews, and feedback.
  - Monitor key metrics and iterate quickly based on user insights.

### 10. Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
- **Advanced Content Interpretation:**  
  - Extend capabilities to include image and video analysis.
- **Persistent Overlay via Native Apps:**  
  - Investigate persistent overlays (e.g., PiP mode) that remain visible across different apps on iOS and Android.
- **Voice Interaction:**  
  - Integrate voice commands for hands-free operation.
- **Alternate Delivery Mechanisms:**  
  - Consider developing a dedicated browser extension or PWA for a more integrated experience.
